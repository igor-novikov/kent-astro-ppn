<p><i>Protoplanetary nebula (PPN) have not been simulated with a molecular code. Numerical simulations with (dzeus v3.5) are carried out to highlight the interaction of protostellar winds with the central star (CS). High-resolution observations made by ALMA of molecular lines from PPN is used as source material for comparison between theory and observations.</i></p>

<h3>1 Observations</h3>
<p>The launching of high-velocity jets are among the most exiting, short-lived events in a life of a star in a transitional period from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) to the PN phase. Imaging and spectroscopy of emission of molecular lines is used to determine kinematic ages of jets. As a result, the observations are made with millimeter CO tracer lines. Information about the tilt of the system is required because only projected quantities are measured.<p>

<b>1.1 Time Evolution MS-AGB-PPN-PN of intermediate-mass stars<br /></b>
<ul>
<li>The Star starts it's evolutionary track by moving up and leftwards in the HR diagram, it swells up to giant proportions and cools down becoming a red giant.</li>
<img src="AGB.png">
<center><i>Figure 1: Evolution of stars of different masses are represented in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The asymptotic giant branch is marked AGB in the case of a star of 2 solar masses.</i></center></p>

<li>Next the outer layers are ejected out forming a dense cloud of gas and dust that obsqures the visible light from the star. This stage called pre-planetary or proto-planetary nebula PPN is hard to observe as it is so faint, only IR emissions from the dust cloud and reflected star light are observed.</li>
<li>It is also a very short period in stellar evolution &#126;  10&#179; years making these objects scarse.</li>
<li>Images of PPN made by Hubble show a wide variety of shapes hinting at complex dynamics</li>
<li>Further on as the star ejects its outer layers to form the cold PPN nebula, the core of the star is left behind</li>
<li>Throughout the time period of PPN, the gas in the PPN is exited by the radiation from the core.</li>
<li>At the end of that period the faint PPN nebula becomes a bright planetary nebula PN.</li>
<li>Eventually the gas in PN is diffused into space leaving behind a dense, dim white dwarf and the matter ejected by PN forms new building blocks for next generation of stars.</li>

<b>2.3 Nature of Jets<br /></b>
<p>Velocity, mass and energy distribution of Jets is constrained from their emission mechanism. Molecular emission in Protostellar Jets is generated when the constituent H2 atoms undergo an a certain rotational/vibrational transition between quantised energy levels. Molecular hydrogen posesses a permanent quadrupole moment enabeling rotational transition in O,Q or S branch. Most common transition is a 1&#8211;0S(1) line at 2.12&#956;m which is a rotational/vibrational transition.

<h3>3 Method </h3>
<ul>
<li>We start up with a slow wind in 2D cylindrical symmetry with dzeus code.</li>
<li>A second wind is turned which is faster and less dense</li>
<li>The interraction of winds is followed.</li>
<li>IDL is used to calculate the atomic lines in the optical spectrum , molecular lines are calculated in the infrared and submillimetre.</li>
<li>Final step is to move from 2D to 3D with Zeus-mp.</li>

<b>4.1 Heavy & Light Jets<br /></b>

<p>One of the key features in description of Jets is the η parameter which represents the ratio of densities of the jet ρjet, and ambient medium, ρamb
 </p>

<p><img src="eq1.png"><br/>

<p>This ratio leads to classification of two parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light jet &#951;<1</li>
<li>Heavy jet &#951;>1</li>
</ul>

<p>Light jets are associated with extragalactic jets whereas heavy jets are usually associated with protostellar outflows. Another usefull quantity determines the shape of propagating jets.
 </p>


<p><img src="eq2.png"><br/>

<p>Where V<sub>ws</sub> is the velocity of the working surface which is expressed in terms of jet beam velocity V<sub>1</sub> and the density ratio &#951;. The above equation describes the resulting shape of the jet and is consistent with the results. When the jet is classified as light, then V<sub>1</sub> < V<sub>ws</sub>. This configuration leads to an expanded cocoon with a working surface sweeping up material from the ambient medium. In case of a heavy jet with V<sub>1</sub>>V<sub>ws</sub>, the jet beam appears to be highly collimated and ploughs ahead , preventing the working surface from dominating and with little ambient material being entrained. Our recearch is concentrated on protostellar jets and winds interacting with the CS.

<h3>4.2 Post-AGB Wind Models</h3>

<p>Our cylindrical grid consists of equidistant 100 x 200 zones in r and z respectively.
The innermost zone lies at the stellar surface and the outermost zone at z_0.
The same input stellar conditions are used as the one used by Pascoli(1997) for an AGB star:ρs =3.5×10−10 gcm−3 and wind speed velocities incide the range 10-20 km/s. A second faster wind is set up with velocity of &#126;50 km/s. The next step is to compute solutions for interacting winds. Two different models are created (A and B) in which spherical and elliptical winds are set up.<br>
The mass loss rate profile has the spatial distribution 
equation.
