<p><i>Protoplanetary nebula (PPN) have not been simulated with a molecular code. Numerical simulations with (dzeus v3.5) are carried out to highlight the interaction of protostellar winds with the central star (CS). High-resolution observations made by ALMA of molecular lines from PPN is used as source material for comparison between theory and observations.</i></p>

<h3>1 Observations</h3>
<p>The launching of high-velocity jets are among the most exiting, short-lived events in a life of a star in a transitional period from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) to the PN phase. Imaging and spectroscopy of emission of molecular lines is used to determine kinematic ages of jets. As a result, the observations are made with millimeter CO tracer lines. Information about the tilt of the system is required because only projected quantities are measured.<p>

<b>1.1 Time Evolution MS-AGB<br /></b>
<ul>
<li>First the Star svels up and cools down becoming a red giant</li>
<li>Next the outer layers are ejected out forming a dense cloud of gas and dust that obsqures the visible light from the star. This stage called pre-planetary or proto-planetary nebula is hard to observe as it is so faint, only IR emissions from the dust cloud and reflected star light are observed.</li>
<li>It is also a very short period in stellar evolution &#126; 10^3 years making these objects scarse.</li>
<li>Images of PPN made by Hubble show a wide variety of shapes hinting at complex dynamics</li>
<li>Further on as the satr ejects its outer layers to form the cold PPN nebula, the core of the star is left behind</li>
<li>Over the time period of PPN stage the radiation from the core exites the gas in the PPN.</li>
<li>At the end of that period the faint PPN nebula becomes a bright planetary nebula PN.</li>
<li>Eventually the gas in PN is diffused into space leaving behind a dense , dim white dwarf and the matter ejected by PN forms new building blocks for next generation of stars.</li>

<b>2.3 Nature of Jets<br /></b>
<p>Velocity, mass and energy distribution of Jets is constrained from their emission mechanism. Molecular emission in Protostellar Jets is generated when the constituent H2 atoms undergo an a certain rotational/vibrational transition between quantised energy levels. Molecular hy- drogen posesses a permanent quadrupole moment enabeling rotational transition in O,Q or S branch. Most common transition is a 1−0S(1) line at 2.12μm which is a rotational/vibrational transition.

<h3>3 Method </h3>
<ul>
<li>We start up with a slow wind in 2D cylindrical symmetry with dzeus code.</li>
<li>A second wind is turned which is faster and less dense</li>
<li>The interraction of winds is followed.</li>
<li>IDL is used to calculate the atomic lines in the optical spectrum , molecular lines are calculated in the infrared and submillimetre.</li>
<li>Final step is to move from 2D to 3D with Zeus-mp.</li>
</ul>

<b>4.1 Heavy & Light Jets<br /></b>

<p>One of the key features in description of Jets is the η parameter which represents the ratio of densities of the jet ρjet, and ambient medium, ρamb
 </p>

<p><img src="eq1.png"><br/>

<p>This ratio leads to classification of two parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light jet η<1</li>
<li>Heavy jet η>1</li>
</ul>

<p>Light jets are associated with extragalactic jets whereas heavy jets are usually associated with protostellar outflows. Another usefull quantity determines the shape of propagating jets.
 </p>


<p><img src="eq2.png"><br/>

<p>Where Vws is the velocity of the working surface which is expressed in terms of Jet beam velocity V1 and the density ratio η. The above equation describes the resulting shape of the Jet and is consistent with the results. When the Jet is classified as ’light’, then V1V. This configuration leads to an expanded cocoon with a working surface sweeping up material from the ambient medium. In case of a ’heavy’ Jet with V1>Vws , the jet beam appears to be highly collimated and ploughs ahead , preventing the working surface from dominating and with little ambient material being entrained. Our recearch is concentrated on ’protostellar’, ’heavy’ jets and winds interacting with the CS.

The results are published during the academic year of 2013/2014.
